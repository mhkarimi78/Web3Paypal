# Web3 PayPal Clone (Moralis, Solidity, Hardhat, NodeJs, React, Web3 API)
In this project with solidity contract you can send and request payment from other people.!
After writing smart contract with silidity, i deployed and verified the smart contract using hardhat and then i used Moralis Web3 Api to interact with smart contract and read data from it. I made a beautiful front-end with Reactjs to make it easy to interact with datas.
